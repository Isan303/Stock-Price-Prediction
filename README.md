# Stock-Price-Prediction
Hello, This project focuses on using Python and machine learning to predict stock prices. The importance of building a stock prediction web app lies in its potential to provide valuable insights and predictions to investors and traders.
The web app allows users to easily access and analyze stock data, which can assist in making informed investment decisions.




## Important Components in the Project
In this section, a brief explanation is provided of the components that are used.
### Streamlit
Streamlit is a Python library for creating interactive web applications.
It simplifies the process of building and deploying data analysis and machine learning tools.
It integrates well with popular data science libraries and provides interactive components for user interaction.
It allows developers to view real-time app output during development.

### LSTM


LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.
It addresses the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs.
They have a memory cell and gates that enable selective memory and forgetfulness.
They are effective in tasks like speech recognition, language translation, sentiment analysis, and stock market prediction.
